# Python-Individual-Projects
Final individual Python projects: Mad Libs Generator game and basic Calculator, showcasing coding and problem-solving skills.

This repository contains two Python projects completed as part of my coursework:

## 1. Mad Libs Generator Python Game
Mad Libs is a game where users fill in random words such as adjectives, nouns, or names without knowing the context of the story, resulting in funny or absurd stories.  

**Key points:**
- Developed in Python using PyCharm
- GUI with 6 story options
- Users input words based on prompts, and the story appears in the console
- Improvements made:
  - Corrected typos and removed unnecessary words
  - Added more story options
  - Enhanced GUI colors and layout
  - Simplified button placement using `pack()`
- Prints my name on start to demonstrate originality

## 2. Calculator in Python
A calculator project with basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and special functions (power, factorial, pi, brackets).  

**Key points:**
- Developed in Python using PyCharm
- Fixed multiple bugs in the original code to improve stability and accuracy
- Improved GUI:
  - Button colors and display layout
  - Rows and columns expand evenly
- Added small improvements to improve user experience
- Prints my name on start to demonstrate originality
